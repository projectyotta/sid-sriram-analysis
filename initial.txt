Hypothesis : Sid Sriram repeats a lot of his lyrics. 

Process : Get list of all sid sriram songs 
Get the lyrics in telugu or use google transliterate . 
Do a bit of data cleanup (see if there is lemmatization for telugu words) , or just do a google transliterate and call it good . 
 

Analysis and projects on this idea : 
> Then figure out what combination of words best represent the words (also have to consider phrases). Or just do a single word thing. 

> Replicate this for all singers/music directors/lyricists/actors combinations. 
Figure out what combinations work best for success tracked against whatever metric. 

> Get clients who would pay for this kind of analysis. 

Best case scenario for funding : 
After this is a stable enough product , maybe Rana funds us lol.
